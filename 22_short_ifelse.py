# The shorthand syntax can be a convenient way to write simple if-else statements, 
# especially when you want to assign a value to a variable based on a condition.
# However, it's not suitable for more complex situations where you need to execute multiple statements or 
# perform more complex logic. In those cases, it's best to use the full if-else syntax.
